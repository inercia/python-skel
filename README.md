This is just a quick start guide, describing the main things you can do with this code.
If you want deeper details, you should build the documentation...


Generating the documentation
----------------------------

Type `make docs` or `make docs-pdf` on the project root directory.

Building the software
---------------------

Just type `make`. This will get all the dependencies and build everything.

Packaging the software
----------------------

Just type `make rpm`, and a nice rpm will appear the the top directory...
